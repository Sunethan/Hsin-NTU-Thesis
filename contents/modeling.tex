For example, if we are considering the bound states of an impurity centre in an $n$-type semiconductor we may obtain a good description of these states using only wave functions of the conduction band provided the ionization energy $W_I$ is small compared with the forbidden energy gap $\Delta E$. This will be true for the so-called 'shallow' impurity levels given by group V elements in silicon or germanium, but not for the deep-lying impurity levels having energy levels near the cnetre of the conduction band. For the latter the differential equation will be invalid in any case since $V(\mathbf{r})$ is likely to vary too rapidly to enable us to use the approximate method of calculating $V_{jj^\prime}$. In this case, the set of linear algebraic equations must be used and not the wave equation for $F(\mathbf{r})$. In general, the solution of the problem becomes very difficult and has not been carried out in many cases of interest.~\cite{smith1963wave}
